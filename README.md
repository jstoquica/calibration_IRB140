## Robot Calibration for ABB IRB140 Industrial Robot

These scripts of the ABB IRB 140 industrial robot can be used for robot calibration, including forward/inverse kinematics. It is recommended to read the following manuscript to understand the principle and methods of robot calibration, especially the concept of Sub-Regions [1]. In the files, X, Y, Z are the coordinates of the position of the robot’s end-effector in the base coordinate system, d_i and a_i are the length of the links, while Th1, Th2,...,Th6 are the joint angles of the robot.
